# HyperionDev WD T52 - Hangman App
## How to Play
If you don't know how to play Hangman at this point, I'm a bit at a loss for words, but I'll try to explain for you.

The goal of Hangman is to guess the hidden word before you run out of lives.

To generate a random word, click the "New Game!" button.

Click the letters on the right side of the webpage to make your guesses.

If you select 10 incorrect letters, you lose!

## How to Run
This app was created using React.js and Bootstrap.js.

Create a new React App directory in the terminal:
```
npx create-react-app hangman
cd hangman
```
Save the repository files to the Hangman folder.
Start the development server in the terminal.
```
npm start
```
Access the game by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
